    -Used Multimedia Fusion (a gamemaker program)(I hope this is proof that gamemakers don't suck, though if anything they have more disadvantages compared to the serious code language stuff (c++ and such)..


    Left/Right Arrow keys - Move player left and right.
    Up arrow key - Jump
    Right Shift key - attack.

    notes: you can do up to a 3 move attack combo (repeatedly hit the attack key. You can hang onto corners of cliffs, press up while hanging to pull self up, press arrow key away from corner to jump off and away, or press down to drop from the corner. You can also wall jump by holding down the arrow opposite the wall before you hit it (have to jump at the wall, then hold down the correct arrow key).
    Because I dont have anymore time to work on this today, these are main problems listed below, which I'll fix at a later date..
    -enemies dont die.
    -needs more levels/story/ect ect
    -needs music/sounds/ect
